    <p><b>The Brain</b>
    <br>The brain is one of the most complex and fascinating organs in the human body.<br> Serving as the control center of the entire nervous system, it regulates bodily functions,<br> processes sensory information, and enables thought, emotion, and memory. Comprised <br>of various specialized regions, the brain orchestrates everything from the simplest reflexes<br> to the most intricate cognitive processes.                </p>
    <p>The brain is divided into five parts:</p><br><br><br>
    <div class = "positioned-image1"><img src="img/thebrain.png" alt="Description of image"></div>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p><b>1. Medulla Oblongata</b><br>
        
        The medulla oblongata is a continuation of the spinal cord and structurally resembles it. It has two main functions:<br>
        <b>Conduction:</b> The medulla oblongata transmits information to other parts of the brain from the spinal cord and vice versa.
        <br><b>Reflexive:</b> Additionally, the medulla oblongata is responsible for certain basic life functions. It houses centers that control breathing, blood vessel movement, and digestion. In general, the medulla oblongata controls actions such as chewing, sucking, swallowing, sneezing, coughing, vomiting, salivation, and tear production.</p><br><br><br><br>
        <br><p><b>2. Hindbrain</b><br>
        The hindbrain consists of the Pons and the Cerebellum (also Medulla Oblongata is often called a part of hindbrain)
        <br><b>Pons:</b> The primary function of the pons is to conduct information between the spinal cord and the brain.<br> It also transmits signals that control vision, hearing, speech, swallowing, and movement.
        <br><b>Cerebellum:</b> The cerebellum is made up of two hemispheres connected by a structure called the vermis <br>(a worm-like structure composed of bundles of nerve fibers (white matter), representing the axons of<br> individual neurons). The vermis manages posture, muscle tone, supporting movements, and body balance. <br>Dysfunction of the vermis in humans manifests as static-locomotor ataxia (impaired standing and walking). <br>The cerebellum receives signals from brain neurons and directs them to specific tendons and muscles,<br> ensuring movement. It helps us walk, bend and straighten our arms, turn our heads, and stand up.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><p><b>3. Midbrain</b><br>     
        The midbrain is the smallest part of the brain and is divided into two sections:<br>
        <b>Tectum:</b> The corpora quadrigemina are four mounds, called colliculi: two superior and two inferior. The superior mounds process visual information, while the inferior mounds process auditory information. The tectum is responsible for orienting reflexes. For example, the superior mounds control eye movement in response to bright light, while the inferior mounds control head movement in response to sudden sounds. This helps in survival in the wild.
        <br><b>Cerebral Peduncles:</b> The cerebral peduncles are responsible for transmitting information to distant parts of the brain.</p>
        <br>
        <div class = "positioned-image2"><img src="img/Diencephalon.jpg" alt="Description of image"></div>
        <p><b>4. Diencephalon: </b>
            <br>The diencephalon consists of two parts:
            <br><b>Thalamus:</b> The thalamus processes information from sensory organs, except for smell, and acts as a filter, selecting which information is important for other parts of the brain. In children, the thalamus fully forms by the age of eight, which is why children are often unfocused and easily distracted before this age. The thalamus also plays a role in forming primary emotional responses such as aggression, fear, joy, and anger. The thalamus houses the center for pain perception. Pain is a signal from the thalamus that something is wrong. The thalamus distributes information and passes it to the brain areas that need to analyze it.
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Hypothalamus:</b> The hypothalamus regulates metabolism, controls homeostasis, and <br> contains centers for hunger and thirst. The hypothalamus can synthesize hormones and<br> is involved in regulating autonomic functions, such as blood pressure, vascular permeability,<br> thermoregulation, heat dissipation, appetite, metabolic processes, sleep regulation, and mental activity.</p>
            <p></p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><p><b>5. Cerebral Hemispheres</b></p>
        <p>The Cerebral Hemispheres contain approximately <b>16 billion</b> neurons. The cerebral hemispheres<br> have Gyri and Sulci, which are crucial because they increase the surface area of the brain,<br> enhancing its capacity for thinking and other functions.  Without the Sulci, the brain's surface <br>area would be about 2,500 cm², but thanks to them, roughly 2/3 of the area is hidden.<br> The central sulcus divides the cerebrum into two halves: the Right and Left hemispheres.<br> They are connected by the corpus callosum, whichis a bundle of nerve fibers. Other sulci divide the brain <br> into the following lobes: frontal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, and temporal lobe.</p>

            </div>
        </div>-->
        <p><br><br><br><br><b>Frontal Lobe</b><br>The frontal lobe is responsible for speech, thinking, and feeling. Movements are also controlled by neurons located in the frontal part, and it is involved in decision-making, planning, goal execution, and purposeful behavior, as well as motivation and drives. <br> <b>Broca's area</b>, named after the French anthropologist and surgeon Paul Broca who discovered it in 1865,<br> is located in the posterior inferior part of the third frontal gyrus and controls the motor component of speech<br> function, managing the muscles of the face, tongue, pharynx, and jaws. Damage to this area causes motor<br> aphasia (difficulty in pronouncing words). 
            In an article published in October 2012, containing the results of<br> research conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the leadership of Nancy Kanwisher,<br> it is asserted that Broca's area is divided into two zones: one is part of the neural networks responsible<br> for speech production, and the other is part of networks associated with solving mathematical problems<br> and memory.</p>
            <div class = 'positioned-image4'><img src="img/brocas.png" alt="Brocas"></div>
        <p><br><br><br><br><br><b>Occipital Lobe</b>
            The occipital lobe houses the visual cortex, which is responsible for processing visual information. This area includes:
            <br>· The primary visual cortex
            <br>· Visual association areas<br>
            Damage to the occipital lobe can result in: Difficulties in color identification (color agnosia), Hallucinations, Visual illusions (inaccurate perception of objects), and Inability to recognize words.</p>
        <p><br><b>Temporal Lobe</b></p>
        <p>The temporal lobe helps in recognizing sounds and tones of speech, participates in memory storage, and contains centers for taste, speech, and declarative (verbal) memory and emotions. Trauma to the temporal lobe can severely impair word memory, speech comprehension, also it can result in difficulty with identification and categorisation of objects, as well as cause neurological disorders and epileptic seizures.<br><br></p>
        <p><b>Parietal Lobe</b></p>
        <p>The parietal lobe is responsible for various sensory perceptions such as pain, touch, pressure, and temperature. It interprets and recognizes these sensations and also processes proprioceptive stimuli (the ability to perceive the position and movement of one's body or its parts in space). This area integrates somatosensory information and participates in recognizing and recalling the shape, texture, and mass of objects, as well as being responsible for arithmetic, writing, distinguishing right from left, and finger recognition. <br> Damage to the parietal lobe can cause cortical sensory impairments, such as discrimination disorders, inability to recognize objects by touch (astereognosis), and more severe difficulties in spatial awareness of the body.</p>
        <br><br><p><b>Insular Cortex</b></p>
        <p>The insular cortex, or insular lobe, is part of the cerebral cortex located deep within the lateral sulcus.<br> The insular cortex is thought to be responsible for forming consciousness and also plays a role <br> in the generation of emotions and maintenance of homeostasis (the process by which living organisms <br>maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in external conditions.). It integrates sensory <br> and autonomicimpulses from internal organs.</p><br><br>
